## Slide 0 — Title
**On screen:** “Stoney Science — Chemistry for Cannabis Cultivators” + big grow-tent photo.  
**Time:** ~20–25 sec

**Script beats**
- Welcome! Today we’re translating a tiny bit of chemistry into plain grow-room decisions.  
- We’ll zoom in on **colligative properties**—especially **osmotic pressure**, which is how water moves into roots.  
- Promise: no scary math, just practical takeaways.

**Transition line**
> “Let’s start with what ‘colligative’ even means—and why it shows up every time you mix nutrients.”

## Slide 1 — Colligative Properties: what & why growers care
**Time:** ~50–60 sec

**Key ideas (plain English)**
- **Colligative** = effects that depend on **how many** particles are dissolved in water, not which chemical they are.  
  Think: *crowding the water* with ions.
- Four classic effects:  
  1) **Vapor pressure lowering** — water evaporates a bit less easily.  
  2) **Boiling point elevation** — water boils a tiny bit hotter.  
  3) **Freezing point depression** — water freezes a bit colder.  
  4) **Osmotic pressure** — the “pull” that drives water across membranes toward the stronger solution.
- Why growers care: Nutrient solutions are full of ions (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, etc.). Their **count** controls the “pull” on water movement into/out of roots.

**Analogy**
- Imagine a party: the more people (particles) in a room (water), the harder it is to move around (water molecules leave/enter).

**Grower takeaways**
- When you increase EC (more ions), you increase osmotic pressure.  
- Too few particles → sluggish growth; too many → osmotic stress (leaf tip burn, wilting even with wet media).

**Transition**
> “So water follows particles. Let’s peek at what that looks like inside a root.”

## Slide 2 — Osmosis in Roots
**Time:** ~55–65 sec

**Key ideas**
- **Osmosis** = water moves from where it’s **less crowded** (lower ion concentration) to where it’s **more crowded** (higher ion concentration) through a **semipermeable membrane**.
- If the solution **outside** the root is **too strong** (hypertonic), water leaves the cells → droop/stress.  
- If it’s **too weak** (hypotonic), cells swell → can stress membranes.  
- **Sweet spot** (isotonic-ish for that stage) = steady water inflow + nutrient transport.

**How plants cope**
- Open/close **aquaporins** (water channels).  
- Build **osmolytes** (small molecules) inside cells to hold water.  
- Use different **pathways** (through cell walls vs. through cells) to route flow.

**Tells in the canopy**
- Hypertonic: tip burn, stiff leaves, droopy midday even with moisture present.  
- Hypotonic/underfed: pale new growth, slow vigor.

**Transition**
> “In hydro, solution strength is the steering wheel for this. EC is our dashboard number.”

---

## Slide 3 — Hydroponics = Managing Solution Strength
**Time:** ~55–65 sec

**EC as a proxy for osmotic pressure**
- **EC (mS/cm)** roughly tracks ion concentration → practical stand-in for osmotic pressure.  
- Stage-based guardrails (typical): **0.8–1.3** (seedlings), **1.2–1.6** (veg), **1.6–2.0** (flower). Adjust by cultivar and environment.

**Operational tips**
- **Log EC in/out** (or runoff). If **out > in** all week, salts are concentrating → dilute or refresh.  
- **Mass balance:** Plants remove water faster than nutrients during hot/dry spells → EC creeps up. Top off with plain water to hold target EC.  
- **Irrigation rhythm:** Short, frequent pulses stabilize EC around roots in coco/rockwool.

**Common pitfalls**
- Chasing pH without watching EC. Both matter; EC captures the **osmotic** side of the story.  
- “More food = more growth.” Not if osmotic stress throttles water intake.

**Transition**
> “Let’s play with a slider to see what ‘too low / just right / too high’ feels like.”

---

## Slide 4 — Interactive: Find the Sweet Spot
**Time:** ~60–75 sec

**What the sim shows**
- **Slider** changes EC.  
- **Labels** switch between *hypotonic / isotonic / hypertonic*.  
- **Arrows** on the cell graphic shift direction/strength to show water flow.

**How to demo (talk while you move the slider)**
1. Set **~0.8–1.0 EC** → say: “Hypotonic. Water rushes in—great for seedlings, but too low later can mean underfeeding.”  
2. Set **~1.4–1.6 EC** → “Isotonic-ish. Balanced intake. This is a comfy veg range for many cultivars.”  
3. Set **>2.0 EC** → “Hypertonic. Water leaves cells; the plant fights to hold water—watch for tip burn.”

**Short answers to likely questions**
- **ppm vs EC?** Roughly, 1.0 mS/cm ≈ 500–700 ppm (depends on meter scale). Track **one** system consistently.  
- **Does temperature matter?** Yes—hotter rooms increase transpiration; EC can drift up faster.

**Transition**
> “Quick two-question check—then you’re ready to tune your reservoir like a pro.”

## Slide 5 — Quick Check (2 questions)
**Time:** ~60 sec total

**Q1. Colligative properties depend on…**  
**Correct:** number of dissolved particles.  
**Why:** It’s the count, not the chemical identity, that drives these effects.

**Q2. If solution is too concentrated…**  
**Correct:** roots **lose** water (osmotic stress).  
**Why:** Water moves toward the stronger solution outside the cells.

**Prompt for discussion (optional)**
- “What EC have you found works best in early flower for your setup?”

**Transition**
> “Let’s leave you with sources to dig deeper.”

---

## Slide 6 — References
**Time:** ~20–30 sec  
Keep brief—point to repo/handout for full list.

**Talking note**
- “These sources span indoor fertigation, root water transport, and recent cannabis-cultivation studies that connect nutrient composition with yield and cannabinoids.”

---

## Lightning Cheatsheet (for yourself)
- **Too low EC** → underfed, pale, slow.  
- **Too high EC** → tip burn, droop despite wet media.  
- **Hold target EC** by replacing water losses and refreshing mix routinely.  
- **Track trends** (in vs out) more than single numbers.  
- **pH is about nutrient *availability*.** EC is about **osmotic pull** and water movement.

---

## Optional Q&A Prompts
- “Why might two cultivars need different EC at the same stage?” *(leaf thickness, transpiration rate, genetic differences in ion uptake)*  
- “How would hot, dry VPD vs cool, humid VPD change your EC strategy?” *(hot/dry → EC drifts up faster; consider more frequent top-offs/dilution)*

> Adjust pacing: If the room is super engaged at the slider, shorten Q&A and wrap with the three takeaways: **Watch EC, mind mass balance, and adjust by stage/cultivar.**
